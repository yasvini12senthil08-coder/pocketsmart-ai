# Phase 4: Project Planning - PocketSmart AI

## 1. Project Development Milestones & Schedule

| Milestone ID | Phase / Activity | Description & Tasks | Status / Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MS-01** | Setup & Configuration | Repository initialization, Python virtual environment setup (`venv`), and dependency installation (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `google-generativeai`). | Completed |
| **MS-02** | Backend Core Setup | Developing `main.py`, configuring FastAPI routing, and building the secure `gemini_client.py` API wrapper. | Completed |
| **MS-03** | Frontend UI Development | Designing responsive HTML templates (`base.html`, `dashboard.html`, `login.html`) using Jinja2 and custom CSS styling. | Completed |
| **MS-04** | Testing & Documentation | Writing automated test scripts (`pytest`) and organizing project files into academic SDLC branches. | Completed |

## 2. Resource & Risk Management Plan
* **API Rate Limits**: Handled by caching structured fallback responses and structuring prompts efficiently.
* **Environment Security**: Sensitive API keys are isolated in local `.env` files and excluded from public version control via `.gitignore`.
* **Scalability**: Single-purpose Python modules allow easy addition of new planning features (e.g., travel planner) in future iterations.
